History for Java Interface

2006-01-18
----------
- Libraries and example can now be built with ant:
  After compiling the swig wrappers:

  call  'ant' to build libraries and example
  call  'ant clean' to remove content

  There is no easy way to use ant to start the program at the moment.
  To start the example type:

    java -Djava.library.path=$1 -classpath .:nmcom.jar -jar example.jar $2 $3 $4

  where you substitute 
    $1 with the path to the *.so libraries
    $2 with the driver (ALSA,NETMIDI)
    $3 with the midi input device
    $4 with the midi output device

  for example this can look like
    java -Djava.library.path=/usr/local/lib/ -classpath .:nmcom.jar -jar example.jar ALSA /dev/snd/midiC1D0 /dev/snd/midiC1D0

----------
- Swig wrappers are now fully working and usable
  - Wrappers for listener classes are receiving messages from the libraries
  - c++ standard library templates are wrappers are working (std::vector<T>,
    std::list<T>)
  - Exceptions defined in the libraries are translated to Java Exceptions
  - Exception classes are derived from java.lang.Exception

- example application
  - The example is a java implementation of the c++ nmedit project.
    It is not possible to control parameters. But the application
    is able to receive events.

- changes
  - I had to place the file 'director.swg' in directories of
  libnmprotocol and libnmpatch as workaround for a bug in swig.
  The bug is already fixed in CVS version of swig.
  - Most of the definitions in nmpatch.i, nmprotocol.i, pdl.i, ppf.i are
  rolled out to 'nmpatch-config.i', 'nmprotocol-config.i', 'pdl-config.i',
  'ppf-config.i' (in directory java-nmcom/swig.i/) because they require
  several other swig-interface files. I wanted to seperate them from
  the c++ source code.

- note
  The java-wrappers are successfully generated with swig 1.3.25 .
  swig 1.3.24 should work too.

----------
- New Project Directory 'java-nmcom'
- swig:Java-Sources are associated with packages.
  SConstruct files for libnmpatch,libnmprotocol,libpdl,libppf
  are modified to direct files generated by swig to the 'java-nmcom'
  source folder:

  directory                package                swig files for
  nmcom/swig/nmpatch       nmcom.swig.nmpatch     libnmpatch
  nmcom/swig/nmprotocol    nmcom.swig.nmprotocol  libnmprotocol
  nmcom/swig/pdl           nmcom.swig.pdl         libpdl
  nmcom/swig/ppf           nmcom.swig.ppf         libppf
