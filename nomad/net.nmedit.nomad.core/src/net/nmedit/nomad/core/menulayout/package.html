	<p> The menu layout package provides a simple framework for automated menu building.
		The menu structure (layout) can be described in xml (see http://nmedit.sf.net/MenuLayout schema).
		The {@link net.sf.nmedit.application.menulayout.MenuBuilder} class uses a resourcebundle
		to setup the menu entries. When the resource bundle is changed all menu items are automatically
		updated. Thus when the locale is changed only a few lines of code are necessary to update
		the whole menu contents.
